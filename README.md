ðŸš— Rental Car Smart Contract
Welcome to the Rental Car Smart Contract! This guide will help you understand, deploy, and interact with the smart contract for a seamless car rental experience on the Ethereum blockchain.

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Prerequisites
Ensure you have the necessary tools and environments set up:

Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix or Truffle).
Node.js and npm installed.
Metamask wallet for interacting with the contract on the browser.
Step 2: Compile and Deploy the Contract
Open your preferred Ethereum development environment.
Copy the code from Rent.sol.
Compile the smart contract.
Deploy the contract to a local blockchain or a testnet.
Step 3: Interact with the Contract
Renting a Car
Users can rent a car by calling the rentCar function.
Send a transaction with at least 2 ether to cover the rental fee.
Check the transaction status and confirm the successful rental.
Returning a Car
Only the contract owner (manager) can call the returnCar function.
Provide the car ID as an argument.
Confirm the successful return, and a refund (75% of the rental fee) will be sent to the user.
Step 4: Monitor Contract Details
View the contract details, including the owner, rental fee, and rented cars, using the public variables and functions.
Step 5: Security Considerations
Ensure the security of the contract owner's address and manage private keys securely.
Consider additional security measures based on your deployment environment.
Step 6: License
Understand the licensing terms of this project, as it is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
Step 7: Customize and Extend
Feel free to customize the contract for your specific use case and explore additional features or improvements.
